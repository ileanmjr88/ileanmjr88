## Hobbies
On my spare time I do make time to have fun! Recently for the past year I have been playing golf whenever I get a chance. It gets me outdoors and it has been a way to clear my head. I also like to take picture, I am no professional but I like using as much as natural light as possible. I do also my gaming needs, I love playing role playing games, favorite games in reacent years are: **God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon, Spider-man.**
I also haven't travelled but the little I have I absolutely loved walking all through Barecelona, Spain.
